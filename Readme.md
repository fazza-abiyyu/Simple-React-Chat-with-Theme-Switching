# Project Overview

This project is a web-based application with a **Flask backend**, **React frontend**, and **MongoDB** as the database. The application allows users to register, log in, and interact with a chatbot. The chatbot feature includes querying and changing themes (light/dark) via user commands, powered by the **Gemini AI API**.

### **Architecture**

1. **Frontend (React):**  
   The frontend is built using React, providing an interactive interface where users can register, log in, and interact with the chatbot.

2. **Backend (Flask):**  
   The backend is built with Flask, handling user authentication, serving the chat API, and interacting with the database.

3. **Database (MongoDB):**  
   MongoDB is used to store user information and chat history.

4. **Gemini AI API:**  
   The chatbot's AI functionality is powered by the Gemini AI API, which allows the chatbot to understand and process user inputs, including commands for changing themes.

### **Tech Stack**
- **Frontend:** React
